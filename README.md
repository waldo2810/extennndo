# extennndo
waassbb's version of @ennntropy's Extendo

### yea but what is it?

Extennndo comes from me using [extendo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extendo-by-entropy/khpnlcdpdacpjnpmglleohjnmpgpdoon)

I realized I could do a slightly better version of it.
Mainly, the problem was that there was some sort of overflow that no matter what I do it was not possible to get rid of.

So there it is, feel free to PR.
